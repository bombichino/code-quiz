# code-quiz

## An Early Push

This web app produces a coding quiz to be taken, the goal of which is to track scores and compare with peers. As the web app utilizes local storage, the peers must, of course, take the quiz on the same machine. However, it delivers all of the needed functionality described below.

Projecting down the line, some tweaks would included updated and modified CSS and improved accessibility tags to begin. I do have some questions and research to do on this subject and will be a focus heading into the next assignment.

## Chief Execution

Utilizing material from all weeks leading up to four (and the occasional trick picked up during week 5 for reference and inspiration), created the complete HTML, CSS, and Javascript from scratch.



## Assignment Criteria

04 Web APIs: Code Quiz
As you proceed in your career as a web developer, you will probably be asked to complete a coding assessment, which is typically a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive challenges. Build a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
